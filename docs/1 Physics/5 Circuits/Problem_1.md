# Problem 1
## ‚ö° Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

---

### üéØ Motivation

Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental task in circuit analysis. While applying series and parallel rules manually works for simple circuits, it quickly becomes impractical for **complex networks**.

**Graph theory** provides a powerful and structured approach:

- **Nodes** ‚ü∂ Circuit junctions  
- **Edges** ‚ü∂ Resistors (edge weights = resistance values)

This representation enables algorithmic simplification and is ideal for:
- Circuit simulation
- Optimization problems
- Automated analysis tools

Graph-based methods not only streamline calculations but also deepen our understanding of the **relationship between math and physics**.

## üß† Task Options

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Simplified Task ‚Äì Algorithm Description

Describe an algorithm that calculates the equivalent resistance using graph simplification:

#### üìå Goals:
- Detect and reduce **series** and **parallel** resistor combinations.
- Continue until the graph reduces to a single edge between two terminals.


#### üí° Nested Combination Handling

- **Series** detection uses degree-2 internal nodes.
- **Parallel** detection identifies multiple edges between the same node pair.
- Repeat until only one edge remains between terminals.

- **R‚ÇÅ = 5‚ÄØŒ©**  
- **R‚ÇÇ = 10‚ÄØŒ©**

**Total Resistance**:  
**R‚Çëq = R‚ÇÅ + R‚ÇÇ = 5 + 10 = 15‚ÄØŒ©**

# Function to draw a wire
def draw_wire(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    ax.plot([x1, x2], [y1, y2], color='black', linewidth=2)

# Function to draw a resistor symbol

**‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency & Improvements**

The current algorithm is suitable for small to medium-sized circuits, especially those composed of clear series and parallel combinations.
For larger and more complex graphs, consider the following enhancements:

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU):
Useful for efficiently identifying and merging connected components during simplification, especially when analyzing multiple parallel branches.

Laplacian Matrix + Kirchhoff‚Äôs Laws:
For arbitrary and highly connected networks, applying Kirchhoff‚Äôs Current and Voltage Laws using the graph Laplacian enables precise analysis through linear algebra. This method scales better and is ideal for automated circuit solvers and simulations.

These improvements enable more robust and scalable solutions, especially when dealing with real-world electrical networks or integrating circuit analysis into larger computational systems.
