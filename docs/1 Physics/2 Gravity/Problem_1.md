 Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Exploring Kepler’s Third Law
🚀 Motivation
The motion of celestial bodies follows remarkably consistent patterns. Johannes Kepler’s Third Law, which relates the square of the orbital period to the cube of the orbital radius, elegantly captures this regularity for bodies in circular orbits around a much more massive central body. This law underpins our understanding of gravitational forces in systems ranging from satellites around Earth to exoplanets orbiting distant stars.

📐 Kepler’s Third Law – Derivation for Circular Orbits
For a body in a circular orbit around a much larger mass (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the centripetal force required for circular motion is provided by the gravitational force:

🧠 Implications for Astronomy
This relationship enables astronomers to:

Measure distances to planets if the orbital period is known.

Infer masses of celestial bodies (e.g., stars, planets) using orbital dynamics.

Predict orbits of moons, satellites, or exoplanets.

Detect exoplanets via transit timing variations and radial velocities.
