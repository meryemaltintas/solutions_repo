# Problem 1
# üìä Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations

---

## üéØ Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a cornerstone of probability and statistics. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a **normal distribution** as the sample size increases, regardless of the original population‚Äôs distribution. Simulations provide an intuitive, hands-on way to observe this phenomenon in action and help understand how randomness behaves in the long run.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simulating Sampling Distributions

We begin by selecting various population distributions:

- **Uniform Distribution**
- **Exponential Distribution**
- **Binomial Distribution**

For each distribution, we generate a large synthetic population dataset using NumPy.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sampling and Visualization

We randomly sample data from the population and calculate the **sample mean** for different sample sizes:

- Sample sizes: **5, 10, 30, 50**

Each sampling process is repeated multiple times (e.g., 1000 times) to construct the **sampling distribution of the sample mean**.

The results are visualized using histograms to observe how the shape of the distribution evolves with sample size.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Simulation function
def simulate_clt(population_func, pop_params, sample_sizes, n_simulations=1000):
    plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
    
    for i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):
        sample_means = []
        for _ in range(n_simulations):
            sample = population_func(size=n, **pop_params)
            sample_means.append(np.mean(sample))
        
        plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)
        sns.histplot(sample_means, bins=30, kde=True, color="cornflowerblue")
        plt.title(f"Sample Size = {n}")
        plt.xlabel("Sample Mean")
        plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    
    plt.suptitle("Sampling Distribution of the Mean", fontsize=18)
    plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0, 1, 0.96])
    plt.show()

# Sample sizes to try
sample_sizes = [5, 10, 30, 50]

# Uniform distribution
print("üîπ Uniform Distribution")
simulate_clt(np.random.uniform, {'low': 0, 'high': 10}, sample_sizes)

# Exponential distribution
print("üîπ Exponential Distribution")
simulate_clt(np.random.exponential, {'scale': 2.0}, sample_sizes)

# Binomial distribution
print("üîπ Binomial Distribution")
simulate_clt(np.random.binomial, {'n': 10, 'p': 0.5}, sample_sizes)
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Parameter Exploration
üîç Shape and Convergence

Distributions like the Exponential are initially skewed, but the mean's sampling distribution becomes more symmetric with larger sample sizes.
The Uniform distribution converges more quickly since it's already symmetric.
The Binomial distribution, being discrete, smooths out with increasing n.

üîç Variance Impact

The spread (standard deviation) of the sampling distribution decreases as sample size increases.
This reflects the law of large numbers: larger samples yield more stable, accurate estimates of the population mean.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Applications
The CLT plays a vital role in many fields:

üìè Estimating population parameters from small samples.
üè≠ Quality control: detecting anomalies in manufacturing processes.
üíπ Finance: modeling and forecasting market averages or risks.
Understanding the CLT helps in making informed decisions even under uncertainty, by using averages from random samples.
