# Problem 1
# ‚ö° Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

## üéØ Motivation

The **Lorentz force** governs the motion of charged particles under the influence of electric and magnetic fields. It plays a foundational role in fields such as plasma physics, particle accelerators, electromagnetic traps, and space physics. The force is defined by the equation:

\[
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
\]

Where:
- \( \vec{F} \) is the total force on the particle,
- \( q \) is the electric charge,
- \( \vec{E} \) is the electric field,
- \( \vec{B} \) is the magnetic field,
- \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the particle.

By simulating this force, we gain intuition into how particles behave in controlled environments like cyclotrons or natural ones like the Earth‚Äôs magnetosphere.

## üß† Real-World Applications

The Lorentz force is pivotal in many systems, including:

- **Cyclotrons**: Charged particles undergo circular motion due to magnetic fields, gaining energy from oscillating electric fields.
- **Mass Spectrometers**: Ions are deflected by magnetic fields depending on their mass-to-charge ratio.
- **Tokamaks and Magnetic Confinement**: Plasma particles follow helical paths confined by toroidal magnetic fields.
- **Hall Effect Sensors**: Electrons pushed sideways by the Lorentz force create a measurable voltage.
- **Auroras**: Solar wind particles spiral along Earth's magnetic field lines, interacting with the atmosphere.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Methodology

We simulate a charged particle‚Äôs motion under different configurations of electric and magnetic fields using the **Euler method**, solving Newton‚Äôs second law:

\[
\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{q}{m} (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
\]

We examine three primary scenarios:
1. **Uniform magnetic field only**
2. **Uniform electric and magnetic fields (parallel)**
3. **Crossed electric and magnetic fields (perpendicular)**

# Constants

m = 9.11e-31  # Mass (kg)

        a = F / m
        v[i + 1] = v[i] + a * dt
        r[i + 1] = r[i] + v[i + 1] * dt

üìà Simulation Results and Interpretation
We visualize the results from each field configuration:

üîÅ Case 1: Uniform Magnetic Field Only
The particle follows a circular path due to the influence of a magnetic field. This motion is described by the Larmor radius:
$$
r_L = \frac{m v_\perp}{q B}
$$
Where:

- \( r_L \): Larmor radius (radius of circular motion),
- \( m \): particle mass,
- \( v_\perp \): component of velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field \( \vec{B} \),
- \( q \): electric charge,
- \( B \): magnetic field strength.

This scenario produces **uniform circular motion** in the plane perpendicular to \( \vec{B} \).
üåÄ **Case 2:**  
\( \vec{E} \parallel \vec{B} \) ‚Äî Parallel Electric and Magnetic Fields

When the electric field \( \vec{E} \) is parallel to the magnetic field \( \vec{B} \), the particle undergoes **helical motion**. It spirals along the direction of the magnetic field while simultaneously being accelerated by the electric field:
$$
\vec{v}(t) = v_\perp \hat{\theta}(t) + v_{\parallel}(t) \hat{z}
$$
The circular motion remains in the plane perpendicular to \( \vec{B} \).

The particle gains speed along the field direction \( \hat{z} \), forming a helix.

‚û°Ô∏è **Case 3:**  
\( \vec{E} \perp \vec{B} \) ‚Äî Crossed Electric and Magnetic Fields

In this configuration, the particle undergoes **spiral motion** while also drifting in the direction perpendicular to both \( \vec{E} \) and \( \vec{B} \). This drift is described by the \( \vec{E} \times \vec{B} \) drift velocity:
$$
\vec{v}_d = \frac{\vec{E} \times \vec{B}}{B^2}
$$
The motion still includes circular components due to \( \vec{B} \).

The particle drifts in a straight line at constant speed \( \vec{v}_d \).
üßÆ Parameter Effects
Increasing Magnetic Field: Decreases the Larmor radius, tightens the spiral.

Stronger Electric Field: Increases the drift speed in crossed fields.

Heavier Particles: Larger mass means a larger radius and slower acceleration.

Charge Sign: Positive/negative particles spiral in opposite directions.
