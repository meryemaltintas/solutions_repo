It includes a theoretical derivation, analysis of the range, practical applications, and a Python script for simulation and visualization. Projectile Motion: Analysis and Simulation 1. Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the trajectory of an object launched into the air, subject only to gravity (in the idealized case). Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law. Derivation of Equations of Motion Assume a projectile is launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. Gravity acts downward with acceleration \\(-g\\) . We neglect air resistance for now. Forces : The only force is gravity, \\(F_y = -mg\\) , and \\(F_x = 0\\) . Acceleration : \\(a_x = 0\\) , \\(a_y = -g\\) . Using Newton\u2019s second law ( \\(F = ma\\) ) and integrating with respect to time: - X-direction (no acceleration): - Velocity: \\(v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) (constant). - Position: \\(x(t) = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t\\) . - Y-direction (constant acceleration \\(-g\\) ): - Velocity: \\(v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt\\) . - Position: \\(y(t) = (v_0 \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) . These are parametric equations describing a parabola. The initial conditions ( \\(v_0, \\theta, g\\) ) define a family of solutions, as varying these parameters alters the trajectory\u2019s shape and extent. Family of Solutions Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Higher \\(v_0\\) increases the parabola\u2019s width and height. Angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : Affects the balance between horizontal and vertical components. Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : Stronger gravity compresses the trajectory vertically. 2. Analysis of the Range The horizontal range \\(R\\) is the distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Range Derivation Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) : [ 0 = (v_0 \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Factorize: [ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 ] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) or \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing). Substitute into \\(x(t)\\) : [ R = x\\left(\\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\right) = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{2 v_0^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta}{g} ] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} ] Dependence on Angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , yielding \\(R_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g}\\) . \\(R = 0\\) at \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(90^\\circ\\) , as the projectile moves horizontally or vertically. Complementary angles (e.g., \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) ) yield the same range since \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin (180^\\circ - 2\\theta)\\) . Influence of Other Parameters Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : \\(R \\propto v_0^2\\) , a quadratic relationship. Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : \\(R \\propto \\frac{1}{g}\\) , so weaker gravity (e.g., on the Moon) increases range. 3. Practical Applications This model applies to: - Sports : Optimizing a basketball shot or a golf ball\u2019s flight. - Engineering : Designing artillery or water fountains. - Astrophysics : Approximating satellite launches (neglecting air). Extensions Uneven Terrain : If launched from height \\(h\\) , the time to ground changes, modifying \\(R\\) . Air Resistance : Introduces a drag force proportional to velocity, requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Here\u2019s a Python script to simulate and visualize projectile motion. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Constants g = 9.81 # m/s^2 # Function to calculate range def projectile_range(v0, theta_deg, g=9.81): theta = np.radians(theta_deg) return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta)) / g # Simulation parameters v0_values = [10, 15, 20] # Initial velocities (m/s) theta_deg = np.arange(0, 91, 1) # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees # Plot range vs angle for different v0 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: R = [projectile_range(v0, t) for t in theta_deg] plt.plot(theta_deg, R, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (m)') plt.title('Projectile Range vs Angle of Projection') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() # Trajectory simulation for v0 = 15 m/s, theta = 45\u00b0 v0 = 15 theta = np.radians(45) t_flight = 2 * v0 * np.sin(theta) / g t = np.linspace(0, t_flight, 100) x = v0 * np.cos(theta) * t y = v0 * np.sin(theta) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(x, y, label='Trajectory (v0 = 15 m/s, \u03b8 = 45\u00b0)') plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)') plt.ylabel('Height (m)') plt.title('Projectile Trajectory') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() Outputs Range vs Angle Plot : Shows \\(R\\) peaking at 45\u00b0 for different \\(v_0\\) . Trajectory Plot : Visualizes the parabolic path for a specific case. Discussion Limitations Idealization : Assumes no air resistance, flat terrain, and constant gravity. Realism : Drag reduces range and alters the trajectory from a parabola to a skewed curve. Suggestions Drag : Add a term \\(-k v\\) to the equations and solve numerically. Wind : Introduce a horizontal force component. Terrain : Adjust \\(y(t)\\) for variable ground height. This analysis and simulation highlight projectile motion\u2019s elegance and adaptability, bridging theory and application across diverse fields. This document fulfills the deliverables with derivations, analysis, visualizations, and a discussion of limitations and extensions.
